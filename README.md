# dr4ft [![Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/dr4fters/dr4ft.svg)](https://gitter.im/dr4fters/dr4ft)

*dr4ft* is a <kbd>NodeJS</kbd> based web-application that simulates draft and sealed format between players and/or bots.
Most of MTG sets are playable thanks to MTGJson support. We follow as much as possible the rules that determine how a real booster is created.

The application provides the following features:

* Draft and sealed format
* Regular, Cube and chaos game types
* 1 to 100 players
* 1 to 12 packs per player
* All playable sets ever printed
* Import your custom set and play it
* In-game chat
* Pick Timer
* Autopick
* Suggest lands
* Kick players
* Connection indicators
* Pick confirmation
* Grid and column view
* Card sorting by rarity, type, color or Manacost
* Bots
* Notifications when a pack is available
* API to create and manage a game remotely. [More docs here](https://github.com/dr4fters/dr4ft/bloc/master/doc/api.md)

## Technologies

*dr4ft* is written in [ES6] and transpiled with [Webpack] and [Babel], and uses [React] on the client-side.
The application uses [SocketIO] and the Websocket technology between client and server.
